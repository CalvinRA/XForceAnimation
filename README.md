# XForceAnimation

Please upload all assets you have to your local repository and then put in a pull request. The file types that should be submitted are maya files (as .ma, NOT .mb), and static meshes (name with the prefix SM, save them as FBX files, NOT OBJ). Once we have rigged models, we want those also as FBX files, and with the prefix SKM (for skeletal mesh)


Things that should NOT be uploaded are Substance files (.sbsar, .sbs, .sbsprs), Houdini files (.hipnc), or texture files (.jpg, .png, .exr, .hrd). We will be sharing texture files, but we will be doing that through probably a Google Drive folder, so as not to go over the storage limit on our repository for as long as possible.
